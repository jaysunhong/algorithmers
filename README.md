### Project Description:
Your mission is to defeat Thanos! To achieve this, you must click the Infinity Stones presented to you towards the bottom of the website. Each Infinity Stone generates a random number and the value of each Stone is hidden from you until you click on it. You must click the Stones to get a sum total that matches the Thanos' number. The number must be exact and cannot be any higher or any lower than Thanos' Random Number. Good luck!
